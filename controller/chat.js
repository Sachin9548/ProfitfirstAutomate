How is our ad spend contributing to revenue and customer acquisition?
By correlating ad platform spend with website analytics, we track conversions back to ad sources. Paid ads account for X% of total revenue and Y% of new customer acquisitions over the last quarter.
Channel Breakdown:

Google Ads: A% of new customers, CPA: ‚ÇπB

Meta Ads: C% of new customers, CPA: ‚ÇπD

Which is performing better ‚Äì Google or Meta Ads?
Each platform serves a different purpose:

Google Ads: Best for bottom-funnel, high-intent search conversions.

Meta Ads: Ideal for top-funnel brand awareness, retargeting, and discovery.
Use both in synergy and tailor creatives accordingly.

What is our paid customer ratio?
This metric reflects our dependency on paid channels for growth. While effective, it's essential to build organic channels (SEO, content, social media, referrals) to diversify traffic and lower CAC over time. Also compare LTV of paid vs. organic users to ensure long-term profitability.
