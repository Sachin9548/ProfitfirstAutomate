      <p><em>"I‚Äôm Anurag Dutta, founder of Gonoid. We make oversized graphic tees ‚Äî bold designs, relaxed fits, the kind of clothes you can live in. We‚Äôve been growing steadily on Shopify, spending around ‚Çπ13,676 a month on Meta Ads. On paper, sales looked good ‚Äî we were averaging ‚Çπ36,055 in monthly revenue ‚Äî but the truth is, I never knew our actual net profit after ads, shipping, and RTO. Every week felt like guesswork."</em></p><br/>

      <h3>üí° An Eye-Opening Week</h3>
      <p>When we onboarded Profitfirst Analytics, the first week alone was eye-opening. The dashboard showed me everything in real time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Ad Spend:</strong> ‚Çπ13,676</li>
        <li><strong>Gross Revenue:</strong> ‚Çπ36,055</li>
        <li><strong>RTO Loss:</strong> 4 orders (~13.8%)</li>
        <li><strong>Shipping & Packaging Cost:</strong> ‚Çπ2,928</li>
        <li><strong>Net Profit:</strong> ‚Çπ7,745 after all deductions</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>"Before this, I never had this clarity without juggling 3‚Äì4 platforms and a spreadsheet."</em></p><br/>

      <h3>ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations</h3>
      <p>Midway through the month, the AI Assistant flagged that our ‚ÄòNOISEKISS ‚Äì Lips Tee‚Äô cold audience campaign had a ROAS of 1.53x in Ads Manager ‚Äî but after factoring in a 13.8% RTO and higher-than-average shipping cost, the real ROI was much lower. It suggested moving budget from that campaign into our best-performing retargeting ad set.</p><br/>
      
      <h3>üìà The Shift and The Results</h3>
      <p>We made the shift. In the following two weeks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue increased from ‚Çπ21,800 to ‚Çπ36,055 <strong>(+65%)</strong></li>
        <li>Net Profit jumped from ‚Çπ4,400 to ‚Çπ7,745 <strong>(+76%)</strong></li>
        <li>Overall RTO dropped from ~17% to 13.8%</li>
        <li>CPP improved from ‚Çπ520+ to ‚Çπ472</li>
        <li>Ad Spend decreased by ~‚Çπ11,000 while maintaining sales volume</li>
      </ul><br/>

      <h3>‚òï A New Morning Ritual</h3>
      <p><em>"The WhatsApp daily reports are my new morning ritual ‚Äî ‚ÄòYesterday: ‚Çπ3,600 revenue, ‚Çπ1,360 ad spend, ‚Çπ775 net profit‚Äô ‚Äî all before my coffee. And the predictive revenue modelling has changed how I order stock. For me, Profitfirst isn‚Äôt just about tracking ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making decisions with confidence. And for a growing brand like Gonoid, that‚Äôs priceless."</em></p>

      <p><em>"I used to check sales and orders daily but had no clear view of profit, spending, or margins. It was frustrating not knowing where we stood."</em></p><br/>

      <h3>The Challenge: Growth Without Clarity</h3>
      <p>Silly Cartel, a premium streetwear brand, was growing but lacked clear insights into performance. This led to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An inability to clearly track and understand real profits.</li>
        <li>Overspending on advertising, resulting in inefficient use of their budget.</li>
        <li>Persistent obstacles in managing expenses and reinvesting for sustainable growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>"Sales were growing, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if we were truly making money,"</em> the founder recalls.</p><br/>

      <h3>The Solution: An All-in-One Dashboard</h3>
      <p>Silly Cartel implemented Profit First to gain a clearer understanding of their spending and profitability. Key steps included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connecting Shopify, Meta Ads, and Shiprocket into a single, real-time dashboard.</li>
        <li>Using visual financial reports to easily track revenue, spending, and profitability.</li>
        <li>Leveraging an AI strategy assistant for actionable growth suggestions based on live performance.</li>
        <li>Utilizing predictive modeling to forecast revenue and profit to plan ahead with confidence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>‚ÄúProfit First was easy to use and made things clear from day one. The team was super helpful and always there when we needed support,‚Äù</em> says the founder.</p><br/>

      <h3>The Result: Smarter, Profitable Decisions</h3>
      <p>With Profit First, Silly Cartel finally had full visibility into their numbers. As a result:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their net profit margin grew from 8% to 13%‚Äîa <strong>31% increase</strong>.</li>
        <li>With extra cash on hand, they could try out new products and campaigns without stressing over cash shortages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>‚ÄúBefore Profit First, we were mostly guessing. Now, we actually understand our numbers and make decisions that feel right. It‚Äôs made a big difference,"</em> the founder notes.</p>
